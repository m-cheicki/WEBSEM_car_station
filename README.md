## How to use

As the project is hosted in a web server, just [click in the link](https://car-station.mcheicki.com/). <br/>
It takes some time, so don't worry, and wait few minutes :) <br/>
Once the web page is loaded, you can either choose to use your location or not. Then, you will be able to see all stations. <br/>
_For development purposes, we have decided to limit our main query to 500 results._

You can click on the left panel where there are all the results. It will show you the selected car station. <br/>
You can also filter by type of car: either thermic or electric. And also, you can enter a zipcode in the search bar. <br/>

## Our APIs

To realise this project we have used two APIs :

-   [Electric car stations](https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/fichier-consolide-des-bornes-de-recharge-pour-vehicules-electriques-irve/table/?flg=fr)
-   [Thermic car stationns](https://data.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/stations-services-en-france%40datanova/api/?flg=fr&disjunctive.typeroute&disjunctive.commune&disjunctive.codepostal&disjunctive.services&disjunctive.carburants&disjunctive.activite)

The first one gives us more than 20,000 entries and the second one around 10,000 which gives us a total of 30,000 data approximatively. <br/>

## Our ontology

Our ontology is available [here](https://electric-car-park.mcheicki.com/ontology/ontology.owl).
